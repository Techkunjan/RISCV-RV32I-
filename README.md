# üß† Single-Cycle RISC-V RV32I Processor

This repository presents the design and implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V RV32I processor using Verilog HDL. It serves as an educational project to understand the fundamentals of processor architecture and the RISC-V instruction set.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project involves creating a single-cycle processor that executes instructions from the RV32I subset of the RISC-V ISA. The design emphasizes simplicity and clarity, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a foundation for more complex processor designs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Single-Cycle Execution**: Each instruction is fetched, decoded, and executed in one clock cycle.
- **RV32I Instruction Set**: Supports the base integer instruction set with 32-bit registers.
- **Verilog Implementation**: Written in Verilog HDL for FPGA synthesis.
- **Testbenches**: Includes testbenches for simulating and verifying the processor's functionality.
